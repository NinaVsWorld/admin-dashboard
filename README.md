## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

I created the admin dashboard using HTML & CSS. The layout was created entirely with CSS grid.

## Lessons Learned
Grid is not as intuitive to me as Flexbox but I'm confident that with continued practice, it will click better. It took a while for me to grasp that there can be grids within grids (similar to flexboxes within flexboxes), however, once I figured it out, the assignment became more straightforward. I still struggle with choosing the right units to use for rows and columns, so I ended up using max-content for many elements. I kept forgetting the difference between justify/align self and content so I just alternated them until I got my desired results (justify/align/place items was easier to remember).
